# Unity Core

Unity Core is a set of highly useful, generic tools built for the Unity 3D game engine. You can pull this source directly into your project's Assets/Scripts directory.

There are 5 categories of tooling in this package:

 1. Menu Management
 2. Audio Management
 3. Scene Management
 4. Data Management
 5. Session Management

### Menu Management

Managing menus and other various UI elements is hugely important. At a high level, we want to create a system of switches for menu content, or various pages in our projects. To get more control, we may also want to create control structures for animation queueing.
